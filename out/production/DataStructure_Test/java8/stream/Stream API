What is the Stream ?
--> Streams can be defined as a sequences of elements from a source which support data processing operations.
Why Stream ?
--> Almost every Java application use Collections API to store and process the data. Despite being the most used Java API, it is not easy to write the code for even some common data processing operations like filtering, finding, matching, sorting, mapping etc using Collections API . So, there needed Next-Gen API to process the data. So Java API designers have come with Java 8 Streams API to write more complex data processing operations with much of ease.
Characteristics Of Java 8 Streams
1. Streams are not the data structures
2. Stream Consumes a data source
3. Intermediate And Terminal Operations  intermediate example – filter(), distinct(), sorted() terminal -ount(). min(), max()
4. Pipeline Of Operations :- A pipeline of operations consists of three things – a source, one or more intermediate operations and a terminal operation
5. Internal Iteration : all stream operations do the iteration internally behind the scene for you.
6. Parallel Execution : To gain the performance while processing the large amount of data, you have to process it in parallel and use multi core architectures.
                        Java 8 Streams can be processed in parallel without writing any multi threaded code. For example, to process the collections in parallel, you just use parallelStream() method instead of stream() method.
7. Streams are lazily populated
8. Streams are traversable only once
9. Short Circuiting Operations


Java 8 Stream Operations :
========================

1. Stream Creation Operations
    1.1 empty() : Creates an empty stream
    1.2 of(T t) : Creates a stream of single element of type T
    1.3 of(T… values) : Creates a stream from values
    1.4 Creating streams from collections
2. Selection Operations
    2.1 filter() : Selecting with a predicate
    2.2 distinct() : Selects only unique elements
    2.3 imit() : Selects first n elements
    2.4 skip() : Skips first n elements

3. Mapping Operations
    3.1 map() : Applies a function
