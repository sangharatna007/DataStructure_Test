Sets represents a collection of sorted elements. Sets do not allow the duplicate elements. Set interface does not provides no guarantee to return the elements in any predictable order; though some Set implementations store elements in their natural ordering and guarantee this order.

Some useful classes which implement Set interface are – ConcurrentSkipListSet, CopyOnWriteArraySet, EnumSet, HashSet, LinkedHashSet and TreeSet.
